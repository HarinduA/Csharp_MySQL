Connection String:

The connection string specifies the server (Server), database (Database), and credentials (User Id and Password).
Modify the connection string with your actual server name, database name, and login credentials.
SqlConnection:

This object manages the connection to the database.
SqlCommand:

This object is used to execute a command (e.g., an SQL statement) against the database.
Parameters:

Use AddWithValue method to add parameters to the SQL command, which helps to prevent SQL injection.
ExecuteNonQuery:

This method is used for executing commands that do not return any data (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Exception Handling:

Wrap the operations in a try-catch-finally block to handle any exceptions that may occur and ensure that the connection is closed properly.
Testing and Debugging:
Make sure your SQL Server is running and accessible from your application.
Replace placeholder values in the connection string and SQL command with actual values.
Run the application in Debug mode to catch any errors or issues.
